# resource-repository
Resource Management System using Java, Spring, Spring Boot, Angular 7.

This is a resource management application that implements CRUD operations as well as basic search functionality for the model classes of a Resource and a Team, on which a Resource may belong.

There is the potential to update this application with some of the new innovations in this tech stack. However, this is not something I will be working on going forward.
